# PatrolSpectatorPlugin Development Log

## Current Status (2026-08-13)
- **Version**: 1.9.96
- **Branch**: `feature/patrol-logic-update`
- **Build Status**: Passed (`mvn clean package`)
- **Key Features Included in v1.9.96**:
    - **`/patrol` Command Access**: Restricted all `/patrol` subcommands and tab completions strictly to OP (`sender.isOp()`).
    - **`/patrol back` (Manual Start Recovery)**: Saves pre-patrol inventory, armor, and location to `last_manual_start_state.yml` and restores upon `/patrol back`.
    - **Dungeon Built Flag**: Added `built: true` in `dungeon_config.yml` to prevent duplicate auto-generation on restarts.
    - **Performance Overrides**: Forced `forceViewDistance` and `forceSimulationDistance` per world on startup.
    - **Legacy Stats Expansion**: Extended legacy importer to include `playerKills` and `eventPoints`.
    - **`/patrol travel` Improvement**: Uses player's current location to find distant villages (3000-8000 blocks away).

## System Notes
- **OneComme Integration**: Discontinued/Not used in production. Chat integration operates via Discord / Minecraft built-in listener.

## Fast Context Restoration Protocol
- Next session entrypoint: Read this file (`DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`) and run `git status -s` first.
- Avoid large unconstrained `git diff` or full directory scans unless specific details are needed.
